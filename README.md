#Cicada3301

I'm currently one of the few who are trying to crack the encryption on the 58 images found on onion7 from the 2014 Cicada puzzle. This is mainly to share with other people who might be able to help. 

Most information was obtained from http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Uncovering_Cicada_Wiki 

If you are new to the Cicada puzzles and are interested the above wiki has a fairly indepth record of the puzzles. Two of the 58 images from onion7 have been cracked. The last page, 57 (counting from zero), was unencrypted and said the following:

Parable : like the instar tunneling to the surface.

We must shed our own circumferences. Find the

divinity within and emerge.

Page 56 was encrypted with a stream of (prime numbers -1) % 29 and strangely enough the 57th character (56 counting from zero) was not shifted. Rather it was skipped and the shift value was used for the next rune. The text from page 56 is below.

IT IS THE DUTY OF EUERY PILGR

IM TO SEEK OUT THIS PAGE.

Currently I am playing with the modRunes script to try to play with the runes and make some sense of the other pages. Hopefully a hint to the hash will eventually be found.
