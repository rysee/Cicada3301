THE LOSS OF DIVINITY: THE CIRCUMFERENCE PRACTICES THREE BEHAVIORS WHICH CAUSE THE LOSS OF DIVINITY.
 
CONSUMPTION: WE CONSUME TOO MUCH BECAUSE WE BELEIVE THE FOLLWING TWO ERRORS WITHIN THE DECEPTION.
 
    1 WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OR THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
 
 
    2 WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOW BY LUCK, AND WE WILL NOT
    BE STRONG ENOUGH LATER TO OBTAIN WHAT WE NEED.
 
MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH CONSUMING:
 
PRESERVATION: WE PRESERVE THINGS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE ARE WEAK. IF WE LOSE THEM WE WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GAIN THEM AGAIN. THIS IS THE DECEPTION.

 
MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH PRESERVING:
 
ADHERENCE: WE FOLLOW DOGMA SO THAT WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT. OR WE FOLLOW REASON SO WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT.
 
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT.TO BELONG IS DEATH.
 
IT IS THE BEHAVIORS OF CONSUMPTION, PRESERVATION, AND ADHERENCE THAT HAVE US LOSE OUR PRIMALITY AND THUS OUR DIVINITY:
 
SOME WISDOM: AMASS GREAT WEALTH. NEVER BECOME ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU OWN. BE PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT YOU OWN:
 
AN INSTRUCTION: PROGRAM YOUR MIND. PROGRAM REALITY
